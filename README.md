# NSLKDD-Project
This is an ongoing project to perform dimensionality reduction over the NSLKDD dataset

The dataset has been obtained from 
https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html
It contains 43 Features

I have used the 20% subset of the datatset which contains 25,192 instances

I have started by creating a Logistic Rgeression Model for the dataset using Scikit Learn Library.
The dataset is being classified into 2 classes: Normal and Anomaly 
Basic Data manipulation and preprocessing has been performed by using Pandas Library.
