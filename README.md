# NSLKDD-Project
This is an ongoing project to perform dimensionality reduction over the NSLKDD dataset

The dataset has been obtained from 
https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html

I have used the 20% subset along with the full dataset for all types of Data Preprocessing techniques and ML models

The above link provides with 2 separate datasets for testing and training, so I have not used the train_test_split() function.
The datasets can be found in the "Datasets" folder

The dataset is being classified into 2 classes: Normal and Anomaly. 

Basic Data manipulation and preprocessing has been performed by using Pandas Library.

As of now I havem made several models using Logistic Regression and Decision Tree algorithm.
These models vary by the different Data Preprocessing techniques used in them
