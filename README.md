# NSLKDD-Project
This is an ongoing project to perform dimensionality reduction over the NSLKDD dataset

The dataset has been obtained from 
https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html

I have used the 20% subset of the datatset which contains 25,192 instances and 43 features

The training and testing datasets used are in two separate files, "NSLKDD Train for Classification" and "NSLKDD Test for Classification" respectively.

I have started by creating a classification model for the dataset using Logistic Regression

The dataset is being classified into 2 classes: Normal and Anomaly. 

Basic Data manipulation and preprocessing has been performed by using Pandas Library.
