These are the original datasets obtained from https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html
There are two files:

1. A 20% subset of the NSL-KDD dataset 

2. The testing dataset

The dataset is unlabeled and contains 3 features of string datatype namely, "Protocol Type", "Service" and "Flag"

The dataset that I have used for classification, I have removed those string datatypes and converted the target variable "Class" into binary numbers 
based on the two classes chosen i.e. "Normal" & "Anomaly"

Normal:0

Anomaly:1
